    "## A Hacker's Guide to Having Your NYTimes Article Comments Noticed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem: predicting the number of upvotes ('recommendations') that a comment posted to an article on the [New York Times](www.nytimes.com) will receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Vm9tAsj.png?1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers of the [Gray Lady](www.nytimes.com) are able to post comments on articles and react to the comments of others by either upvoting ('Recommend' button) or replying. For a comment-author, recommendations are desirable because they bring about more visibility - recommended comments float up to the top where they are seen by more readers and can receive even more upvotes. Once a comment 'snowballs' it can be seen by potentially millions of readers. Presumably we write comments because we want others to see them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got curious about what makes some comments rise to the top while most others are completely ignored. [Aashita Kesarwani](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita https://www.kaggle.com/aashita) posted a cool dataset on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) of more than 2 million comments geared toward addressing this and similar questions. Be sure to check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/nyt-comments) as well as her wonderful exploratory data analysis of it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/exploratory-data-analysis-of-comments-on-nyt/data). The data come from two time periods: Jan-May 2017 and Jan-April 2018 and contain features on both the comments (with the full raw text body of each comment) and the more than 9 thousand NYTimes articles the comments were responding to.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like this as a prediction task because it is challenging. Presumably what makes people upvote comments or posts, not just at the Times but also in other social media settings (Reddit, Twitter, FB, etc) is the _meaning_ of the comment - they find it helpful, or funny or simply agree with it and want others to see it too. Since we can't easily quantify 'meaning,' we'll have to rely on some feature engineering in order to get any traction with our predictions. The task is also challenging because we don't know much about the readers who are responding to comments and do not have the full text of the articles. Additionally, some comments are pretty short, so they are not easily amenable to a more complicated language model. After extracting what we can from the features already present in the dataset, we will have to wrangle useful information out of noisy and messy raw text - the body of the comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point to consider here is that we need to set our expectations low, because this is no handwritten digit recognition exercise with 99%+ accuracy. Even a human scorer would probably not do well in terms of predicting upvotes. Consider these two comments, both made in responde to the same article:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. '_Everyone should have walked out.  Spicer could have talked to himself._'\n",
    "\n",
    "B. '_If people are \"alarmed\" and \"appalled\" that Trump did this, followed by his cronies justification of it, then they haven't been paying attention. I'm just surprised he took this long to do it. The story here, the one that people should actually be alarmed and appalled by is that the rest of the press stayed. Brietbart, One America, not so surprising but there is absolutely no excuse for rest to have shown so little respect for the one of the most important and defining features of America... The First Amendment, a free press. To echo Mr Kahn's question to President Trump...have you even read the constitution? Here, let me give you a head start... Amendment I: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances._'\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any contextual knowledge, I would have guessed that the two comments would be roughly on par or the first one would receive fewer upvotes. They are generally similar in terms of the reaction to the article, though the second comment is longer and contains more information. The reality is quite different: comment A received over 10,000 upvotes and is the most upvoted comment in the entire dataset, while comment B got ... zero upvotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in the takeaways (and one very plausible explanation about the popularity of these two comments, it is not simply brevity!), skip right to the last section. In the sections that follow we will go through the traditional steps of classification, with an emphasis on feature engineering out of the numerical and text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original target variable here is a count variable of recommendations. For the artificial purpose of using classification algos and metrics, I will discretize it to four meaningful and roughly equal-sized categories. Since the largest of them is about 29%, this is our prediction baseline: if we simply picked that always, our classification would be accurate 29% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories:\n",
    "1. None ~29%\n",
    "2. One or two ~29%\n",
    "3. Three to eight ~23%\n",
    "4. More than eight (up to tens of thousands) ~18%\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, you also choose to keep the original target variable (though cropping the right tail of the distribution might be a good idea due to how skewed it is) and rely on regression and metrics such as mean squared error. (In that case, it would probably be most appropriate to use a negative binomial model for the first simple fit, due to the count nature of the data and the fact that zero has meaning.)\n",

    "First, let's prepare the data. We'll load almost all features present in the .csv files in their original shapes into a large dataframe, drop features that cannot be useful (too many missing cases) and convert the categorical features to dummies. This will enable us to do a first-cut prediction without  feature engineering - almost as if we know nothing about the dataset and are doing a blind prediction. 'Almost' because we will deliberately exclude one feature that is surely related to the target - the number of replies a comment has received (**replyCount**). We would expect this to be an effect (consequence), rather than a cause of the number of upvotes - upvoted comments are highly visible and therefore much more likely to receive replies.\n",

    "OK, now we have our first (simple) fit and the first accuracy score - the model classified about 38% of cases correctly, which is an improvement of about 9% over the baseline (constant) model. The classification report shows that the model has the greatest amount of trouble guessing the second category (One or two upvotes), and is considerably better at guessing the fourth (most popular) category (recall column reports the share of cases of each category the classifier was able to correctly identify). Of all of the comments which received between one and two upvotes, our logistic regression classifier was able to recall only about 15%, in contrast to almost 70% for the fourth category (more than eight upvotes).\n",

We'll say more about them in the next section, but these are features such as the length of the original article, the **depth** of the comment, whether the comment was recommended by the NYTimes staff (**editorSelection**), posted by NYTimes staff members or trusted users. While the various categories derived from the **sectionName** variable generally weren't that important, there were a few very popular categories there - for example 'Family' and 'Sunday Review.' Of course, all of the coefficients here are to be interpreted relative to the omitted reference category, but our focus here is on prediction so we won't dwell on the coefficients."

    "Next, let's create a bag of classifiers. We are somewhat agnostic as to the most appropriate one at this stage, so we'll include several. In addition to logistic regression, we'll do Ridge regression (essentially a penalized regression), nearest neighbors and two ensemble models (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost). Feel free to drop in your favorite classifier in the mix. I like XGB both for speed (run on a GPU it is quite fast), which allows more experiments, and for the fact that it can report feature importance - which features were present in more trees and how much gain in coverage did each provide. We won't do much model tuning at this stage, relying on the rather conservative default parameter values baked into Scikit-learn."

This could mean quite a few different things, but here's one way to approach the quantification problem. We expect that popular comments will not be too short (low effort!), will use more sophisticated language (ie more rare words, longer words, longer sentences, etc.), will have no or few spelling mistakes (no excuses now that most browsers offer spellcheck out of the box), and will not be too negative-sounding (positive or neutral sentiment). These are of course little more than hunches at this stage.\n"

    "Using our trained IDF counter, we can transform all comments into a matrix of IDF scores (each row is an array of the IDF scores of the the tokens present in a comment). Then we can use that matrix (and some additional wizardry) to create a bincount - a count of each IDF integer. Think about this as the vocabulary rarity profile of a comment. While we could just rely on the mean IDF (or one of the other basic stats), doing a bincount allows us to probe a little deeper - two comments might have a very different IDF profile yet have the same mean IDF.\n",
    "For additional convenience, we create a simple summarizer function which reports a count, minimum, mean, standard deviation and maximum value given an array. In case a comment contains no recognizable words, we simply assign a value of zero to all measurables. A safer choice here would be to exclude the comment altogether - but very few comments fall in this category so are are not worried about bias too much (especially given the size of the full dataset)."

    "Let's create more features based on more of the indicators we are looking for. Relying on two NLP libraries (TextBlob and the conventional NLTK), we obtain a host of features: basic stats on words and word length, basic stats on sentences and sentence length, sentiment polarity (positive-negative) and subjectivity (subjective-objective) scores, spelling (percent of correctly spelled words), and even part-of-speech breakdown (how many nouns, adjectives, adverbs and so on as a percentage of all words.) The full list of parts-of-speech tags is available \n",

Of course, in terms of spelling we expect lower error rate to be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional small considerations. We put all of these indicators in one large function simply to economize on the overhead associated with multiprocessing. Also, there is a little regular expression magic at the beginning of the function to fix a very common error - no space after end of sentence punctuation (.?!). We fix that because it leads to more noise in all of our features. We spell-check all words which are not 'proper nouns', meaning names, as that should generate more accurate counts. Finally, comments shorter that three characters are coded as all zeros - they are simply too short to get much information. Again, one could also eliminate them out of the sample if worried about bias."

If untruths were a rare occurrence, I might accept his point. But when they are an hourly event, it should make one suspicious that the point is dissemination of propaganda.  So I will continue to read the Journal and will continue to hope that the credible journalists there win the argument. We need all the credible sources we can get.\n",

    "**Longer articles bring in more comments.** \n",
    "Apparently commening on a longer article is associated with more upvotes on comments. There are several interpretations here. One is that readers who read longer articles tend to be more likely to comment and respond to comments. Another is that there are articles which are simply too short to be worthy of much of a response - and beyond a certain article length, it seems there isn't much of an effect. Finally, it is possible that longer articles simply attract more readers which translates into higher overall upvote counts. The plot below gives indications that perhaps all three of these are at play. Clearly articles below 600 words are just too short. On the opposite end of the spectrum, comments made to articles over 2000 words rake in higher counts on average."

Still, the vast majority of comments are to articles on the front and first few pages."
